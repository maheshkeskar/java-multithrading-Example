 * Executor provides execute method to handle async tasks. [void execute(Runnable task)]

 * ExecutorService also has shutdown method to terminate all threads and reclaim memory.
 * examples: submit(Runnable/Callable), invokeAny(List of Callable tasks), invokeAll(List of callable tasks).
 * ThreadPoolExecutor --> implementation of ExecutorService and has Worker for mapping thread and tasks.
